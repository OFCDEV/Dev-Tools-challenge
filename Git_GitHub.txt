Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows multiple developers or other contributors to work on a project. It provides a way to work with one or more local branches and push them to a remote repository. Git is responsible for everything GitHub-related that happens locally on your computer. 

Key features provided by Git include:
  It's installed and used on your local machine
  Handles version control 
  Supports branching

GitHub is a cloud platform that uses Git as its core technology. It simplifies the process of collaborating on projects and provides a website, command-line tools, and overall flow that allows developers and users to work together. GitHub acts as the "remote repository" mentioned previously in the Git section.

Key features provided by GitHub include:

Issues
Discussions
Pull requests
Notifications
Labels
Actions
Forks
Projects

Issues
Issues are where most of the communication between a project's consumers and development team occurs. An issue can be created to discuss a broad set of topics, including bug reports, feature requests, documentation clarifications, and more. Once an issue has been created, it can be assigned to owners, labels, projects, and milestones. You can also associate issues with pull requests and other GitHub items to provide future traceability.

Branches
Branches are the preferred way to create changes in the GitHub flow. They provide isolation so that multiple people may simultaneously work on the same code in a controlled way. This model enables stability among critical branches, such as main, while allowing complete freedom for developers to commit any changes they need to meet their goals. Once the code from a branch is ready to become part of the main branch, it may be merged via pull request.

Commits
A commit is a change to one or more files on a branch. Every time a commit is created, it's assigned a unique ID and tracked, along with the time and contributor. This provides a clear audit trail for anyone reviewing the history of a file or linked item, such as an issue or pull request.

Pull Requests
A pull request is the mechanism used to signal that the commits from one branch are ready to be merged into another branch. The developer submitting the pull request will often request one or more reviewers to verify the code and approve the merge. These reviewers have the opportunity to comment on changes, add their own, or use the pull request itself for further discussion. Once the changes have been approved (if approval is required), the pull request's source branch (the compare branch) may be merged in to the base branch.

Labels
Labels provide a way to categorize and organize issues and pull requests in a repository. As you create a GitHub repository several labels will automatically be added for you and new ones can also be created.

Examples of Labels include:

bug
documentation
duplicate
help wanted
enhancement
question

Actions
GitHub actions provide task automation and workflow functionality in a repository. Actions can be used to streamline processes in your software development lifecycle and implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

GitHub Actions are composed of the following components:

Workflows: Automated processes added to your repository.
Events: An activity that triggers a workflow.
Jobs: A set of steps that execute on a runner.
Steps: A task that can run one or more commands (actions).
Actions: Standalone commands that can be combined into steps. Multiple steps can be combined to create a job.
Runners: Server that has the GitHub Actions runner application installed.
